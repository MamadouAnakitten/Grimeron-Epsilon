# Grimeron Lambda (Build 7.0.0)
An Open Source Tron-like game with intelligent AI.

#Changes Since Grimeron Epsilon
There was a complete UI overhaul.
- Player creation taken out of setup and placed in a tab in the primary tab pane.
- Added icon images to tabs and main window.
- Setup Frame has been turned into a dialogue box that can be toggled on event.
- Player creation is less static and has more flexibility within the program.
- Whole program has been slightly arranged to be more fluidly editable with the new UI.
- Critical logic error with the bot has been resolved and the bot now has perfect recursive searching for longest path. This does not mean that the bot plays perfectly. Equations are being evolved and tested to mimick human-like processing.
- Database development is now a priority and preloading database will come soon.
- Grimeron.java is being rewritten for flexibility.
- Custom fonts will be introduced hopefully in 7.1.0, the next anticipated major release.
- Cleanup, Comments, and Javadocs have been and are being continuously progressed.
